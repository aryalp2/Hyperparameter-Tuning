# Hyperparameter-tuning
The best practices of building good machine learning models is by fine-tuning the algorithms and evaluating the model's performance!
we will learn how to do the following:
-Obtain unbiased estimates of a model's performance
-Diagnose the common problems of machine learning algorithms
-Fine-tune machine learning models
-Evaluate predictive models using different performance metrics
